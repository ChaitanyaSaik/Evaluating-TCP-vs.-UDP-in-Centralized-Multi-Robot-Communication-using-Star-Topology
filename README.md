# Evaluating TCP vs. UDP in Centralized Multi-Robot Communication using Star Topology

## üìú Overview
This project presents a **MATLAB-based simulation framework** that evaluates the performance of **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** and **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** in a **centralized multi-robot communication system** configured in a **star topology**.  
It was the foundation of a **peer-reviewed IEEE conference paper** presented at **IEEE INDISCON 2025**.

The simulation provides a practical, extensible tool for researchers and engineers to analyze the **trade-offs between reliability, latency, and throughput** in communication protocols for robotic networks.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **MATLAB-based simulation framework** for centralized multi-robot systems.
- **Star topology communication model** with a single hub coordinating all communication.
- **Realistic network impairments**: packet loss, jitter, and delay.
- **Protocol-specific modelling**: TCP acknowledgments, retransmissions, and UDP lightweight delivery.
- **Five test scenarios** covering one-to-one, one-to-all, sequential, and parallel communication.
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Throughput, Retransmissions, and Loss Rate.
- **Research-focused tool** for benchmarking and protocol selection in robotic applications.

## üîç Simulation Methodology
- **Robots**: Six autonomous nodes connected via a central hub.
- **Protocols**:
  - TCP: Connection-oriented, acknowledgment-based, retransmissions.
  - UDP: Connectionless, lightweight, minimal latency.
- **Network Faults**: 
  - Packet loss: Bernoulli model.
  - Delay & jitter: Gaussian model.
- **Scenarios**:
  1. One-to-one communication.
  2. Broadcast (one-to-all).
  3. Many-to-one aggregation.
  4. Sequential message transmission.
  5. Parallel multi-destination communication.

## üìä Results
| Scenario | Avg Latency (sec) | PDR (%) | Retransmissions |
|----------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1        | 0.20             | 100.0   | 0               |
| 2        | 0.28             | 96.7    | 3               |
| 3        | 0.33             | 93.3    | 4               |
| 4        | 0.22             | 100.0   | 0               |
| 5        | 0.35             | 91.7    | 5               |

TCP ensures higher reliability but increases latency, while UDP provides faster performance at the cost of packet loss.
